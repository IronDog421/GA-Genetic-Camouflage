# Grid Simulation with Pygame

A dynamic grid-based simulation using Pygame, where each cell represents an organism with a unique DNA value displayed in grayscale. The simulation updates and displays the current generation in real-time.

## Features

- **Organism Grid Visualization**: Each organism's DNA is represented by a grayscale cell within the grid.
- **Real-Time Generation Display**: The current generation number is updated and displayed at each frame.
- **Customizable Frame Delay**: Control the delay between frames to adjust the speed of the simulation.

## Requirements

This project requires `Python 3.x` and the `pygame` library. Ensure both are installed before running the project.

### Pygame Installation

To install Pygame, use the following command:
```bash
pip install pygame

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository

## Set Up the Environment

1. **Python Installation**:

   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:

   To keep your dependencies organized and avoid conflicts with other projects, create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env

## Activate the Virtual Environment

Once you've created the virtual environment, you'll need to activate it to install dependencies and run the project within that isolated environment.

1. **Windows**:

   Run the following command to activate the virtual environment on Windows:

   ```bash
   .\env\Scripts\activate
